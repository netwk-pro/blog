# ðŸ›  FOSS Spotlight: Squircle CE vs. QuickEdit â€“ Which Text Editor Deserves Your Love?

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->

## Looking for a lightweight, open-source text editor that _actually_ respects your privacy and still packs modern power? Meet **Squircle CE**!

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD026 -->

ðŸš€ **Squircle CE** is more than just a pretty interfaceâ€”itâ€™s built on a clean
Material 3 design, supports syntax highlighting for 50+ languages, and includes
all the must-haves like code folding, session management, and Git integration.

<!-- more -->

ðŸ”¥ **How it stacks against QuickEdit:**  
While **QuickEdit** is known for its speed and decent performance, it comes with
closed-source limitations and ads that can hinder user experience. Squircle CE,
on the other hand, is **100% open-source**, **ad-free**, and lets YOU control
the experience.

ðŸ’¬ Why developers are switching:  
âœ… No ads, no tracking  
âœ… True dark mode  
âœ… Lightning-fast code editing  
âœ… F-Droid support  
âœ… Open contributions welcome!

âœ¨ Whether you're debugging scripts or tweaking configs on the go, Squircle CE
has you covered without the bloat or barriers.
