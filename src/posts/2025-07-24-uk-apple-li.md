## ðŸ“¢ _Important update for tech, legal, and policy professionals:_

The UK government has **paused its proposal** to compel Apple to **weaken
encryption on its cloud storage services** â€” a move that would have had sweeping

encryption and refusal to compromise user security.

infrastructure**, this case reminds us of the **delicate balance between
national security and personal privacy**.
