# 🔐 Encryption is not a loophole

## It’s a lifeline

Right now, Congress is considering legislation that could **effectively ban
encrypted apps** by forcing companies to build dangerous backdoors into private
communications.

These proposals threaten the security of journalists, whistleblowers, business
professionals, and everyday users who depend on end-to-end encryption to
communicate safely and confidentially. 💼🛡️

**EFF is sounding the alarm. And we all should be too.**

📣 This isn’t just a tech issue—it’s a fundamental human rights issue. Weakening
encryption undermines trust in our digital infrastructure, increases
vulnerability to cyber threats, and sets a dangerous precedent for global
privacy standards.

It’s time to act. Contact your representatives and demand they protect encrypted
communications and uphold digital rights.
