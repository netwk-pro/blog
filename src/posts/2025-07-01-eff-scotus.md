# üîê Supreme Court Upholds Age Verification Law

## What It Means for Free Speech, Privacy, and the Internet's Future

On **June 27**, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld **Texas‚Äôs HB 1181**, mandating
strict age verification (digital ID or biometric scans) for websites where over
‚Öì of content is deemed "harmful to minors."

This ruling in _Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton_ could reshape the internet as
we know it.

**üß† Key Takeaways:**

- **All users‚Äîincluding adults‚Äîmust now verify their age** through personal IDs
  or biometric data to access _lawful_ content.
- The Court applied **intermediate scrutiny**, rejecting decades of precedent
  that required **strict scrutiny** for restrictions on adult speech.
- The **privacy and cybersecurity implications** are vast: data collection,
  storage risks, and potential for misuse.
- **20+ states** are poised to follow suit with similar legislation.

&nbsp;

**‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Matters:**

This ruling sets a concerning precedent for how digital rights are balanced
against regulatory goals. It could lead to:

- **Massive privacy intrusions**
- **Suppression of lawful speech**
- **Broad government control over digital access**

Organizations like the

warn this could significantly erode First Amendment protections and chill
innovation in privacy-preserving technologies.

**üí¨ We'd like to hear from you:** Do age verification mandates strike the right
balance between child safety and adult freedoms? Or are we moving toward a
surveillance-by-default internet? Let us know at `social (at) neteng.pro`!
