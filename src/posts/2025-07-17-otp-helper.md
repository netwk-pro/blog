# 🔍 FOSS Spotlight: Copy SMS Code – OTP Helper

## Secure. Effortless. 100% Open Source

If you've ever juggled between apps just to copy a one-time password (OTP), you
know how frustrating the process can be.

**Copy SMS Code – OTP Helper** is a minimalist Android app that takes care of
that, seamlessly detecting OTPs from SMS or notifications and copying them
directly to your clipboard—_automatically._ No interaction needed. No internet
access required. No user data touched.

And yes—it’s fully **open source**, under the AGPL-3.0 license. 🔓

### 🧩 Why It Stands Out

✅ 100% offline (doesn’t even request internet permission)  
✅ Choose your workflow: Notification Listener or SMS access  
✅ Compatible with virtually any OTP-based or 2FA system  
✅ Lightweight, privacy-first, and customizable  
✅ Translated into 70+ languages and growing  
✅ Inspect, contribute, or fork on GitHub

This is a perfect example of how small, thoughtful tools can reduce friction in
our everyday workflows—**while keeping user agency and transparency at the
core.**
