# ðŸš¨ Is Outlook quietly turning into Microsoftâ€™s data collection machine?

## Microsoftâ€™s new "Outlook for Windows" is no longer just an email clientâ€”itâ€™s a data-collection engine

Microsoftâ€™s new version of Outlook isnâ€™t just an email clientâ€”itâ€™s a _data
pipeline_ feeding insights to over **801 external partners**. From your
**emails, location**, and **device data** to even your **credentials**, Outlook
could be tracking and sharing itâ€”sometimes without your knowledge or consent.

<!-- more -->

If you're syncing Gmail, Yahoo, or other IMAP accounts through the app,
Microsoft may be reading and storing that information too.

And in the U.S.? Thereâ€™s _no legal obligation_ to disclose this.

This is not just a privacy issueâ€”itâ€™s a **digital trust crisis**.

ðŸ”’ Itâ€™s time to rethink your inbox. Choose an email provider that prioritizes
**security, transparency, and your privacy**â€”not profit from your personal data.

ðŸ‘‰ **Switch to privacy-first email, such as
[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail), [Tuta](https://tuta.com/secure-email), or
[Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net).** Protect your digital life
before itâ€™s quietly sold off in the background.
