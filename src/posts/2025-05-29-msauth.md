# 🔐 Microsoft Authenticator Users: Major Change Incoming

## Microsoft Authenticator is phasing out its password autofill sync feature by July 2025

🚨 Heads up! If you rely on Microsoft Authenticator's password autofill sync to
store or auto-fill your passwords, you'll **lose access unless you export them
NOW**.

But instead of just exporting... consider **upgrading your security**.

💡 We recommend switching to **privacy-first open-source alternatives** like:  
✅ **[Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/)** – End-to-end encrypted, sleek UI,
cross-device sync.  
✅ **[Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/)** – PIN-protected,
backup-friendly, fully offline.

🔓 Transparent  
📱 Feature-rich  
🚫 No tracking  
🧠 Community-driven security

🛡 Take back control of your digital safety today.

📥 Backup & migrate your data now before the cutoff.
